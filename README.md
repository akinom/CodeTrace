# CodeTrace

This repo contains a few algorithm animations that I developed for my High School CS teacher friend, when she mentioned 
that students often have trouble visualizing how code effects data when it executes. 

Therefore I decided to aniate textual code, with variables replaced by current values alongside the current data representation. 

I developed  years ago when JavaScript was the language of choice and classes were not yet done with TypeScript. 
Not cutting edge anymore - but it still works.
